section:GettingStartedDevelopmentProcess[Development process]

Developing model-driven applications works well in combination with an iterative-incremental development
process. In this approach you start with a small model which will then be enhanced in several steps whereby
some short tests verify that the direction is correct.

Each cycle consists of the following steps:

ol[
	item[Create or change model]
	item[Regenerate]
	item[Merge changes]
	item[Test intermediate results]
