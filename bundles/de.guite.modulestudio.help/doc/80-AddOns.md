# AddOns

## Introduction

This chapter is about extending ModuleStudio.

There will be different types of extensions for ModuleStudio, but this page is primarily intended for future versions.

### Language packs

At the moment only German locales are shipped with ModuleStudio. These involve all own translation strings, but not those from the Eclipse platform and used frameworks yet. It is planned to make language packs available as optional feature bundles at a later stage. 

### Figure galleries

Not implemented yet though as the modeling language itself must become matured first.

### Template sets

Not implemented yet though as the modeling language itself must become matured first.

### Generator cartridges

Not implemented yet though as the modeling language itself must become matured first.

### Other extensions

As the roadmap is quite open in the long term many aspects are not decided yet. Therefore things may change significantly.

## Extension Points
