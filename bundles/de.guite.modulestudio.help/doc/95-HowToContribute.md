# How to contribute

This chapter shows how you can help improving ModuleStudio.

## Report problems

If you think you found a bug please add an issue for it in our tracker:

* [Generator and tooling](https://github.com/Guite/MostGenerator/issues/)
* [Help and user assistance](https://github.com/Guite/MostHelp/issues)
* [Locales and translations](https://github.com/Guite/MostLocales/issues)
* [Sample models](https://github.com/Guite/MostExamples/issues)

## Help with translations

If you want to create a translation download the latest language pack template from the ModuleStudio download page. This archive contains several English files which you need to translate. Then just send it back as a PR in [this directory](https://github.com/Guite/MostLocales/tree/master/translations).

## Fix documentation problems

If you have corrections or improvements for the manual feel free to fork the [help repository](https://github.com/Guite/MostHelp/), contribute your changes and create a pull request afterwards. For a simple start there are *Edit on GitHub*  links included in documentation pages on the ModuleStudio website.

## Fix generator problems

In case you are able to develop Symfony applications you can also help with fixing bugs in generator. If so, please fork the [generator repository](https://github.com/Guite/MostGenerator/), contribute your changes and create a pull request afterwards.
