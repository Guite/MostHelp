            <text>Added support for json templates in the generator.</text>

            <text>Comprehensive update of modeling language and generator for support of Doctrine 2.1 in the data layer. This includes many new features, like for example the separation of unidirectional and bidirectional associations or the ability to have ordered and indexed relationships. In the generator business entity and model record layers have been merged to one entity layer. This reduces much code and improves understandability as well as the overall application structure. Also we added a new validator framework as well as other functions to keep as much extensions as possible.</text>
            <text>It is now possible to unset optional date values during editing an existing entity.</text>

            <text>Editors: performance of live validation has been improved by closing a memory leak.</text>
            <text>Many bugfixes and corrections, especially for handling relations with Doctrine.</text>
            <text>Factories for business entities and collections: for each application a factory class is generated now, with which instantiation of new business objects is reduced to one line of code. This factory receives also the context from which the object has been asked for. For example this can be an action, a form handler or also a content type. Therewith it is possible to use different business classes depending on the context in specialisations of this factory class.</text>
            <text>Improved handling of user fields: if one has user fields in an entity, editing these fields is now done with an auto complete function in the forms.</text>
            <text>Handling upload fields with different possible settings in the model: you can now model different settings for upload fields, for example the allowed file extensions, the name of the subfolder storing the files or the scheme for naming uploaded files. The generator creates a complete upload handling from that, for images including support for the Thumbnail Module.</text>
            <text>Managing relations: the handling of relations has been overhauled completely, particularly in the edit forms. When editing an entity it is possible to choose, reference and manage (inline editing) other objects with auto complete fields. Each relation has a new property called "edit type" on modeling level. With that one can define on which side of the relation which actions should be possible.</text>
            <text>Improved ajax support: beside the Zikula.ImageViewer also the Zikula.UI library is used. When displaying and editing objects referenced objects are edited or embedded with it.</text>
            <text>Direct validation: when editing entities also client-side validation with validation.js is supported for some field types.</text>
            <text>Description of elements: each model element has a new field for functional documentation. In the main generator this information is only used for the application itself (module description), entities (description text at the top of list views) and their fields (Zikula.UI tooltips for labels in edit forms) at the moment.</text>
