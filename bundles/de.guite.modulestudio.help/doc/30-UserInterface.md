# User interface

## Introduction

This section shows how to use ModuleStudio. Starting with a general demonstration of the user interface it goes step by step through all single editors required for creating a complete model.

At the moment this page consists only of a few links to corresponding tutorials. It will be enhanced at a later stage after the actual modeling language has matured enough to spend work on completing the user interface.

## Basic usage

Please see [this tutorial](http://modulestudio.de/en/tutorial/basic-usage.html).

## Graphical editors

### Main editor

Please see [this tutorial](http://modulestudio.de/en/tutorial/basic-settings-in-main-editor.html).

### Model editor

Please see [this tutorial](http://modulestudio.de/en/tutorial/describing-the-model.html).

### Controller editor

Please see [this tutorial](http://modulestudio.de/en/tutorial/modeling-the-controllers.html).

### Workflow editor

The workflow layer is not implemented yet (planned for version 0.8). This section is just a dummy for future.

## Textual editors

Beginning with ModuleStudio 0.6.0 there is also a textual syntax notation available. Not visible
at once, it will be integrated into the UI step by step.

*Expert tip:* you can use the textual editor already if you like: open the *Open resource* dialog using **Ctrl + Shift + R**, type `*.mostapp` into the filter field and click on the *Open* button.
